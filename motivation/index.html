<h2 id="motivation">My Motivation For Working On Hard Problems (And Working In General)</h2>
<p>I get a lot of questions asking me why I work so much, and what I'm trying to achieve.</p>
<p>A lot of people make grand (and vague) statements about "making the world a better place" but they just say that
    during interviews. They don't really mean it. And they certainly don't act like they mean it, because if they were,
    they would be working a lot harder. This doesn't mean you have to be working 24/7, but it means working as much as
    possible (like 80-90hrs/wk).
    For most people, this is not a sacrifice they're willing to make, and I don't blame them.</p>
<p>But me? I guess I just don't operate that way. I love working, and I know how to tune out the distractions. I know
    how to find and work with other highly talented (and often smarter people). Which makes me love my work even more.
    In particular, I love both AI and spaceflight (but more the latter) because both advance intelligence and
    exploration, respectively.</p>
<p>Because I'm serious about this, I've always tried to take the hardest (while still sensible) option given to me. I
    took as many AP classes in high school as I could. I competed (and placed in the top 50 projects worldwide) at the
    International Science & Engineering Fair. In college, I decided to pursue a Computer Science degree and when that
    wasn't hard enough, I tacked on a Physics degree too. I took the hardest math classes available to me right out of
    the gate. I work on hard problems outside of my 18hr class load, both brainstorming and actually implementing
    them.</p>
<p>This sensibility has served me very well. I'm at Texas A&M on a full ride, I've already got a six-figure job offer
    (before college even) and, most importantly, I've got a good trajectory towards improving human intelligence and
    exploration.</p>
<p>With all of this, I'm hoping to make my mark. Preferably in a big, notable way, but I'd be extraordinarily satisfied
    to be half as influential as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie"> Dennis Ritchie</a> was, while
    being largely unknown. I want to work making life multi-planetary, hopefully by my technical and leadership
    skills. With enough luck and hard work, I might even be able to go to Mars.</p>
<p>So that's why I do it. It might be a sentimental reason, sure, but I've already proven I'm willing to go to extreme
    lengths to progress towards that goal. The big question now? Can I handle the next big set of challenges life throws
    at me, given I'm largely on my own?</p>
<p>You can never know for certain, but I certainly know it's within my capabilities.</p>
