<h2 id="poetry">My Poetry</h2>
<p>Yes, I write poetry. Some of it's good, some of it's... less good. I write about a variety of topics, and I do my
    best to keep it apolitical and not promote any one religion in particular. After all, it'd be stupid to publish
    either one of those positions on the internet. As to the individual subject matter: much of it is impersonal. Much
    of it is purely fictitious. So don't speculate. Don't <em>assume</em> you know my positions or life circumstances,
    because you are probably wrong.</p>
<p>It's a good way for me to relax, get my artistic side out, and develop my writing skills.</p>
<p>> You can access my poetry <a href=https://tiernanxkl.wordpress.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm always open to feedback (you can comment on the articles). If you use it elsewhere, please make sure to get my
    approval and attribute me.</p>

<p>I'll leave you with one last thought:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/48021-we-don-t-read-and-write-poetry-because-it-s-cute-we">
    <p>"We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human
        race. And the human race is filled with passion. So medicine, law, business, engineering... these are noble
        pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love... these are what we stay alive
        for."</p>
